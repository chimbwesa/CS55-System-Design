•	This project is for our client DriverPass
•	The owner of DriverPass wants to provide students with a new way of learning by providing more comprehensive and engaging material. 
•	This new system should include online classes, practice tests, and on the road training. 

System Background
•	Our client asked us to build a system that allows our customers to take online classes, practice tests, and on the road training.
•	The system will run on desktop and mobile devices
•	The system will work online and offline.
•	The system should be compatible on mobile devices and desktop.
•	The system should allow the user to download reports and information that can be worked on at home. 
•	The system should have proper authorization and access privileges for data security. For example, the IT Officer should have full access over all accounts with ability to reset them if someone forgets their password. 
•	The system should allow an activity report to be printed which would allow the authorized user to figure out who is responsible for any changes.
•	Data should be accessible by the user from anywhere, online, and offline. 


I think created the diagrams in a simple and understandable way that anyone could understand. I believe i could improve on minute details during the document design and maybe be more creative in my approach.
I amde sure to folow i directly implement user needs to the design. This is important for their satifaction. To analyze system designs in the future i will utilize crtitcal skills such as asking questions, taking notes, listeing and addressing users needs. 
Breaking down a system into smaller components anf follwing deadlines is essential. Utilizing diagrams such as activity diagrams, sequence diagrams, use case diagrams, and class diagrams will simplify and make for a complete system. 
Following IT practices inline with the SDLC will also be key to my success when analyzing and designing a system.
